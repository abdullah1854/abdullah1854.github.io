# Quick Fix for GitHub Pages Deployment Issue

## Problem
GitHub Pages is serving JSX source files instead of compiled JavaScript, causing the error:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/jsx"
```

## Solution: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)

I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build and deploy your site correctly.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Commit and push the GitHub Actions workflow:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "fix: add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Save

3. **Trigger the deployment:**
   - The workflow will run automatically on the next push to main
   - Or go to **Actions** tab and click **"Run workflow"** manually

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Check the **Actions** tab to see deployment progress
   - Usually takes 1-2 minutes
   - Your site will be live at `https://abdullah1854.github.io`

## Alternative: Manual Deployment (Quick Fix)

If you need to fix it immediately without GitHub Actions:

```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Copy dist contents to root (backup first!)
cp -r dist/* .

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: deploy built files to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

⚠️ **Note:** Manual deployment requires you to commit the built files to your repository. Using GitHub Actions is cleaner as it keeps source and build separate.

## Verify It's Working

After deployment, check:
- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ No console errors about JSX/MIME types
- ✅ All images load correctly
- ✅ Dark mode toggle works
- ✅ All sections are visible

## Why This Happened

GitHub Pages was serving your source files (`index.html` pointing to `/src/main.jsx`) instead of the compiled JavaScript files. The GitHub Actions workflow builds your React app and serves the compiled files from the `dist/` folder, which is what GitHub Pages needs.
